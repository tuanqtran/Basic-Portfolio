					<p>I grew up Port Arthur, Tx which is a small town located about 4 hours from Austin and during that time I went to college and attained my Bachelor Degrees in EE. Afterward, my wife and I moved to Austin which we found to be an amazing place to stay. During that time I have been learning how to program with PLCs (RxLogix 500 with Allen Bradley) and also got into web development. I'm currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at UT Austin that help provide me a strong foundation to become a proficient Full-Stack Web Developer.
					<br><br>
					A few fun facts about me: I was a Lion Dancer for three years, part of a bowling team, high school varsity tennis player and choir.	Also, I am now a proud owner of a Sugar Glider with a name that is still in debate.

					P.S. Hover over me and watch me do a trick.
